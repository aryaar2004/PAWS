assistance, the app helps owners monitor their pets' well-being. It supports
multiple pet profiles, enabling seamless switching between pets. Additionally,
the app includes an e-commerce section for pet products and a pet adoption
feature. Developed as a two-month prototype, this all-in-one solution
enhances convenience and promotes better pet care through AI-driven insights
and management tools.
